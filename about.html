      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <section class="about-short-bio">
  
  <p>
    From childhood, I’ve been captivated by the visuals and music in films like <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Interstellar</em>. Growing up in Pokhara, my curiosity spanned both the arts and the sciences—I loved exploring math and physics as much as I loved losing myself in cinema. Warning: I watch a lot of movies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based in the shadow of the Himalayas, I spend my free time riding mountain trails, swimming in pristine lakes, trekking hidden paths, and scouting unusual locations and characters that spark my creativity. I enjoy cooking (my meals have been known to impress) and am constantly tinkering, questioning, and experimenting with new ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I’ve competed in and won robotics contests, tackled complex math challenges, and contributed to the children’s radio show “Milijuli Bolaun,” funded by NGO Right4Children. I remain fascinated by cinematic storytelling, from Christopher Nolan’s mind-bending narratives to James Cameron’s epic worlds.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am deeply interested in optimized film production with a clear directorial vision, while also tackling technical challenges—think R&D in the style of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>. As a science enthusiast, I aspire to work on projects that push the boundaries of physics, space, and technology. My passions weave together films, scientific exploration, and technological innovation, driving me to merge creativity and technical rigor in everything I do.
